The goal of this notebook is to familiarize economists with the numerical optimization techniques often required for quantitative work, as well as a fairly blatant attempt to sway others towards doing such work in open source software such as Python/Pyomo (or Julia/JuMP, which is faster but I think less flexible in the types of nonlinear problems it can easily adapt to) and combine resources.\n",

    "- Python installation of 2.7 or 3.4+, I recommend Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual\n",

    "- Optimization solvers such as ipopt -- ```conda install -c conda-forge ipopt``` (Note: you may have to debug this, I had to debug a bit on Ubuntu but directions are platform specific). You can install this without Anaconda, but it is extremely complicated. Using conda is **strongly** recommended. \n",

    "To solve this problem, I find that it is necessary to run the solver mutliple times, until the solver reaches a point at which the objective function is sufficiently small (how small is sufficiently small depends on the problem of interest). Often times you will need to restart the algorithm using the solution values reached by a prior run, which can be done simply by running ```opt.solve(instance)``` without redefining the instance. As such, be prepared that you will need to run the code block below potentially several times. I find that it eventually converges to a point of local infeasibility (with an objective of 9.4329010e+02), but at this level, the solution is good enough."

    "In this case, we are able to solve for close to optimal solution values. However, some models will be difficult to solve using the \"IPOpt\" solver (a free, non-linear solver), and sometimes commercial solvers are much, much better at finding solutions to particular types of large problems. Cplex, Gurobi, and Knitro are fast, commercial solvers that you can use instead, but they are not free. CONOPT, in particular, may be a good algorithm here, since we have many nonlinear constraints. I haven't figured out how to get these locally without paying, but we have an institutional subscription to GAMS, which includes (demos to some of) these and many more commercial solvers. Pyomo allows you to write your problem as a script readable by GAMS, which allows for use of its more powerful solvers (without having to code in GAMS). Be aware that many solvers require you to start with a small value of your objective function, so you may need to either scale down your variables and/or objective function by a constant, or solve it first locally and then export the problem later. Solvers may also require variable boundaries that others do not. To do so, run:"
